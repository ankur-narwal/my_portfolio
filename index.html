        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class="dialog-text">
          <p>Hello! I’m Ankur Narwal, a passionate Computer Science student currently pursuing my BCA at Uttaranchal
            University. Technology excites me because it’s not just about code – it’s about solving problems, creating
            meaningful solutions, and pushing boundaries. I thrive on learning, experimenting, and turning ideas into
            real projects that people can interact with and enjoy. <br>

            <br>
            Over the past couple of years, I’ve built a strong foundation in programming and front-end development. My
            toolkit includes C, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a growing interest in prompt
            engineering and AI-driven solutions. I enjoy combining creativity with logic—whether it’s designing
            intuitive interfaces or writing efficient algorithms.<br>

            <br>
          <h3> What I’ve Worked On </h3>

          <br>
          I believe in learning by doing, which is why I’ve explored a variety of projects: <br>
          <br>
          Music Hut – A music streaming and download platform integrated with the Jio Saavn API. <br>
          Chess Wars – A complete chess website featuring AI opponents, puzzles, and tournament play. <br>
          E-Learning Platform – A multi-page responsive platform with course listings, progress tracking, and video
          embedding.<br>
          Quiz Application – A modern, animated quiz app with scoring, explanations, and dark/light mode.<br>
          Real-Time Chat Application – Built with React and WebSockets for smooth, live conversations.<br>
          Portfolio Website – My personal scroll-based showcase of projects, achievements, and certificates.<br>
          <br>
          Each project has been a step forward—not just technically, but in learning how to design user-focused,
          reliable, and scalable solutions.<br>

          <br>
          <h3> Internship Experience </h3>
          <br>
          Recently, I was selected for a Frontend Web Development internship at CODTECH IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
          (June–July 2025). This experience is allowing me to apply my skills in a professional environment,
          collaborate with a team, and sharpen my development practices while working on real-world tasks.<br>
          <br>

          <h3> Certifications & Learning </h3>
          <br>
          Continuous learning is something I strongly believe in. Some of the certifications I’ve earned include:<br>
          <br>
          ● Prompt Engineering in ChatGPT<br>
          ● Data Structures & Algorithms<br>
          ● Generative AI – A Way of Life<br>
          ● Python Course for Beginners<br>
          ● Fundamentals of Java<br>
          <br>

          <h3> Beyond Code </h3>

          <br>
          Away from the laptop, I’ve had the honor of representing my school at the state level in chess, which has
          taught me strategic thinking and patience skills that I carry into my coding journey as well.<br>

          <br>
          <h3> Research Work </h3>

          <br>
          I’ve also ventured into research and recently authored a paper titled “Prompt Engineering in Generative AI,”
          which has been submitted for publication. It reflects my curiosity about the intersection of AI and human
          creativity, and how structured prompts can unlock the full potential of large language models.<br>
          <br>

          <h3>Looking Ahead </h3>

          <br>
          My goal is to grow into a developer who not only writes code but also crafts experiences that truly matter.
          Whether it’s through software development, AI research, or collaborative projects, I’m excited to keep
          learning, innovating, and contributing to meaningful work.<br>

          <br>
          Let’s connect—I’d love to collaborate on something amazing!</p>

        <h2>How I Built My Chess Website</h2>
        <p>
          Building Chess Wars: My Journey of Creating a Complete Chess Website <br>
          <br>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <br>
        Chess has always fascinated me—not just as a game of strategy, but also as a way to bring people together. As a
        developer, I wanted to combine this passion with my coding skills and create something of my own: a chess
        website where anyone could log in, play, solve puzzles, and enjoy the game in a simple, user-friendly
        environment. This project became one of my most exciting learning experiences, and in this post, I’ll walk you
        through the journey.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Why I Started This Project</h3> <br>
        Like many computer science students, I’ve always wanted to work on projects that push my skills while still
        being fun to build. Creating a chess platform felt like the perfect match. It’s interactive, full of logic, and
        always keeps you thinking. And since chess has that timeless appeal, building a place where people can actually
        play and practice felt like I was working on something that truly matters.<br>
        <br>
        <h3>The Features I Built</h3><br>

        Here’s what I focused on while making Chess Wars:<br>
        ● Play Locally – Two players can sit together and play on the same board. Perfect for quick matches with
        friends.<br>
        ● Game Modes – Different ways to play (like puzzles and challenges) so the site doesn’t feel repetitive.<br>
        ● Puzzles Section – I added 50 hand-picked chess puzzles to sharpen tactical skills.<br>
        ● Tournaments & Chat UI – While not fully implemented yet, I laid the foundation for tournaments
        and a chat system to give the site a community feel.<br>
        <br>

        <h3>Technical Side</h3> <br>

        Chess Wars was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the main stack.<br>
        ● HTML – Structured all pages clearly, from the homepage to the puzzle section.<br>
        ● CSS – Used for styling, responsiveness, and the glassmorphism effect.<br>
        ● JavaScript – Powered the logic for the chessboard, move handling, and puzzle integration.<br>
        <br>

        <h3>What’s Next?</h3><br>
        Chess Wars is still evolving. I want to add:<br>

        ● Online multiplayer so people can challenge friends remotely.<br>
        ● Smarter puzzles and training modes for learners.<br>
        ● Community features like leaderboards, chat, and tournaments.<br>
        <br>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
        Building my chess website was more than just a coding exercise—it was about bringing together creativity,
        problem-solving, and my love for the game. It’s a project I’m genuinely proud of, and I believe it reflects both
        my technical skills and my ability to design with users in mind.

        <h2>How to Make Your Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
          How to Make Your First Web Developer Portfolio (That Recruiters Actually Read)<br>
          <br>
         <h4> 1) What this post will help you do </h4><br> 
          
          You’ll go from “I need a portfolio” to a clean, fast, recruiter-friendly site you can ship in weeks — not
          months. We’ll cover the whole flow: goal → theme → structure → projects → writing → build → launch. No fluff,
          just what gets you interviews.<br>
          <br>
         <h4>2) Start with a clear goal (so you know what to show)</h4><br>  
          Pick one primary goal:<br>
          Internship / first job → show fundamentals, small but polished projects, ability to learn fast.<br>
          Junior front-end role → highlight UI craft, responsiveness, accessibility, performance, a couple of real users
          if possible.<br>
          Freelance → show outcomes and business impact (before/after, metrics, testimonials).<br>
          Everything you add should support that goal.<br>
          <br>
          
          <h4>3) Choose a theme & design system (then stick to it)</h4><br>
          A portfolio feels “premium” when the visual language is consistent. Decide this upfront:<br>
          Theme idea (example you can adopt): “Dark Neon Tech”<br>
          Background: near-black (#0e0e0e)<br>
          Text: pure white (#ffffff) and soft gray (#aaaaaa)<br>
          Primary: cyan (#00ffff) for accents, hover, borders<br>
          Accent: mint (#00ffcc) for secondary highlights<br>
          Radius: 12–20px rounded corners<br>
          Shadow: soft, subtle; never blurry glowing unless intentional<br>
          Motion: 150–250ms ease transitions; no wild parallax<br>
          <br>
          Design rules<br>
          <br>
          1–2 fonts max (e.g., Inter for UI, a display font if needed).<br>
          Use a 8px spacing scale (8/16/24/32…); keep paddings consistent.<br>
          Define 3 heading sizes (e.g., 40/28/20), body (16–18), small (14).<br>
          Keep contrast accessible (aim for WCAG AA).<br>
          Pick one button style; use it everywhere (primary/outline variations).<br>
          Lock this in, then stop tweaking colors every day. Consistency beats perfect.<br>
          <br>
         
         <h4> 4) Plan your structure (information first, visuals second)</h4><br>
          A recruiter spends ~30–90 seconds on your site. Make it scannable:<br>
          Hero — Name, title (e.g., “Front-End Developer”), one line value prop, 2 buttons (Download Resume / See
          Work).<br>
          About — 4–6 lines: what you’re good at, what you’re learning, what you want next.<br>
          Projects — 3 strong projects > 10 average ones. Each with a quick case study.<br>
          Skills/Tools — grouped logically (Core, Frameworks, Tooling).<br>
          Writing (optional but great) — short posts or notes.<br>
          Contact — clear CTA; email + social.<br>
          Add a sticky header with simple nav: Home · Work · Writing · Contact. Smooth scroll. Active link states.<br>
          <br>
          
          <h4>5) Pick a simple stack (don’t over-engineer)</h4><br>
          Base: HTML + modern CSS + a little JS is totally fine.<br>
          Optional: React/Vite if you want component reuse; Tailwind if you love utility classes.<br>
          Deployment: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel (all free/easy).<br>
          Bonus: a tiny build step (minify CSS/JS, compress images).<br>
          Remember: the projects matter more than the framework.<br>
          <br>
          
          <h4>6) Projects that earn interviews (what to build & how to present)</h4><br>
          Choose 3 projects that show range<br>
          <br>
          For each project page/card:<br>
          Title & one-line summary (“Interactive music app with playlists & search”).<br>
          Live demo + GitHub links.<br>
          Context: Why you built it (problem).<br>
          Approach: Tech choices, interesting challenges.<br>
          Outcomes: What improved, what you learned (be specific).<br>
          Next steps: if you had one.<br>
          Keep the writing human and concrete.<br>

          <br>
          <h4>7) A simple case-study template you can reuse</h4><br>
          Context<br>
          2–3 sentences: who it’s for, problem, constraints.<br>
          Goals<br>
          What “done” looked like (speed, UX, mobile, accessibility).<br>
          Stack<br>
          Front-end tech and why (short and honest).<br>
          Key challenges<br>
          Bullet the top 2–3 problems and how you solved them.<br>
          Results<br>
          Numbers if you have them. If not: tangible outcomes (e.g., “ran smoothly on low-end phones”).<br>
          What I learned<br>
          Specific takeaways. Shows growth mindset.<br>
          <br>

          <h4>8) Build it clean (layout, responsiveness, performance)</h4><br>
          Layout<br>
          Use a max-width container (e.g., 1100–1200px).<br>
          Generous white space; readable line-length (60–75 characters).<br>
          Grid for projects; stack to single column on mobile.<br>
          Responsiveness<br>
          Performance<br>
          Inline critical CSS, defer non-critical JS.<br>
          Avoid heavy libraries for simple effects.<br>
          Unique title and meta description per page/section.<br>
          Semantic tags: header, main, section, article, footer.<br>
          Open Graph/Twitter meta so shared links look good.<br>
          <br>

          <h4>9) Accessibility (non-negotiable)</h4><br>
          Proper heading order (H1 → H2 → H3).<br>
          Alt text that actually describes the image’s purpose.<br>
          Visible focus states (keyboard users exist).<br>
          Color contrast checked for text and buttons.<br>
          Don’t trap focus in modals; ESC should close.<br>
          This is the difference between “nice site” and “hireable engineer.”<br>
          <br>

          <h4>10) Micro-interactions that feel intentional</h4><br>
          Button hover: subtle scale (1.03) + border/shine; 200ms ease.<br>
          Link hover: underline offset or gentle color shift.<br>
          Cards: 4–6px translate-up on hover; modest shadow change.<br>
          Reduce Motion: respect prefers-reduced-motion.<br>
          Small touches make your site feel “designed,” not just “assembled.”<br>
          <br>

          <h4>11) Content that sounds like you (not a robot)</h4><br>
          Write short, active sentences.<br>
          Swap vague words for specifics.<br>
          “Built a responsive UI” → “Built a 3-breakpoint layout with CSS Grid/Flexbox.”<br>
          Use first person sparingly, and keep verbs strong.<br>
          <br>
          
          <h4>12) A realistic build plan (2–3 weeks)</h4><br>
          Day 1–2: Goal, theme, wireframe (mobile → desktop).<br>
          Day 3–6: Hero, About, and Projects grid.<br>
          Day 7–10: Case study pages/sections, performance passes, accessibility.<br>
          Day 11–12: Writing page or notes (optional), contact section.<br>
          Day 13–14: Polish: favicons, meta tags, 404, social preview images.<br>
          Day 15: Deploy + share + iterate.<br>
          <br>
          
          <h4>13) Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)</h4><br>
          Too many projects → Pick 3 and go deep.<br>
          Inconsistent styles → Decide once, reuse everywhere.<br>
          Walls of text → Break with headings, bullets, images.<br>
          Heaviness → 2–3MB total page weight target is reasonable.<br>
          No contact CTA → Make it obvious and friendly.<br>
          <br>
          
          <h4>14) Final advice (that actually helps)</h4><br>

          Treat your portfolio like a product: solve a problem (show your ability), deliver value (clarity + demos). You don’t need a perfect site; you need a clear one that proves you can build,
          learn, and polish.<br>
          <br>
          If you follow this flow — set a goal, commit to one theme, choose three projects, write short case studies,
          and ship a clean build — you’ll already be ahead of most first-time portfolios.<br>

        <h2>Mastering Prompt Engineering</h2> <br>
        <p>
          When I first came across the concept of prompt engineering, I was fascinated by how a simple change in wording
          could completely shift the way AI responds. It’s not just about asking questions—it’s about knowing how to
          guide the model so that the answers are accurate, creative, and actually useful.
          Over time, I explored different strategies like role-based prompts, zero-shot and few-shot techniques, and
          breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps. What I found most interesting was how even tiny tweaks—like
          choosing the right tone or adding a bit of context—could dramatically improve the results.
          I’ve applied these skills in practical settings, from research experiments to projects where prompts shaped
          the way AI interacted with users. For me, mastering prompt engineering has been about building a bridge
          between human intent and AI capability—making sure the output isn’t just correct, but also meaningful.
